            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm <strong>HuntYoMan</strong>! I'm <strong>15 years old</strong> and have had the opportunity to
                live in a few
                different states, which
                has given me a unique perspective on life and helped me grow in new ways. Music is a huge art of who I
                am â€” I live <strong>playing, creating, and sharing</strong> it with others. But more than that, I'm
                passionate about
                using music to <strong>honor the Lord</strong>. Worshiping Him through songs is one of my greatest joys
                and something
                that keeps me grounded. My faith shapes everything I do, and I hope to inspire others through my love
                for both <strong>music</strong> and <strong>God</strong>.
